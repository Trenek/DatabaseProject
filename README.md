Instructions to set up a game: 
1. First of all you need SQL Server 2022 instance on your computer.
2. It should listen on default port 1433
3. Next you should create login "ProjectApplication" with password "HardPassword"
4. Open sql/BuildAndTest.sql
5. Change ScriptPath variable to a path to BuildAndTest.sql file on your device
6. Next execute this file in SQLCMD mode
7. Alternatively you can execute files that are refered to in BuildAndTest.sql file one by one
8. Now, If everything is set up correctly you can use this application
